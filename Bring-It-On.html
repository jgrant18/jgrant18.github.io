           <h1> Disclaimer </h1>

           <p> Bring it On came out in 2000, I was 9 years old and instantly obsessed with it, 20 years later and I stand by the 9-year-old me that rewatched this movie on VHS far too many times. This movie is perfect and anyone who thinks differently is wrong. I have watched Bring It On countless times and every time it is a joy. I have also seen all of the sequels which are increasingly problematic and I like to pretend they have no connection to this masterpiece. 
            10 minutes in and I acknowledge that this movie is not perfect, the f-bomb is used way too liberally and I will not have that kind of derogatory talk in my house. </p>

            <p class="content__paragraph content__paragraph--c9">Set in the competitive world of cheerleading, <span id="trigger-9" class="pop-text pop-text--s2" data-pop-media="media9">Bring It On, </span>tells the story of the Toros – a high school cheer team– on their way to Nationals. When the new captain Torrance (Dunst) learns that all of their routines are stolen from the East Compton Clovers she embarks on a mission to re-choreograph their routines. Along the way, she learns about privilege, friendship, and love. Bring It On puts women at the front of the story and tackles complex concepts of cultural appropriation, privilege, and gender under the guise of a teen comedy.</p>

          <h1>  The Actors</h1>

          <p class="content__paragraph content__paragraph--c1">Kirsten Dunst is an icon, Virgin Suicides invokes a nostalgia for a time I never lived, 1994’s Little Women is still one of the best adaptations of the book, Spiderman isn’t great but I’d still watch it, in fact, I saw it in the cinema when it came out, On Becoming God in Central Florida is excellent television created in a landscape where viewers are bombarded with trash tv. Gabriel Union deserves more attention for her career and acting; she's criminally underrated. Jesse Bradford really fell off after this movie but is a babe nonetheless and I was straight up obsessed with him and Eliza Dushku. Because of Cliff in this movie I watched Swimfan whose sex scene awoke something deep within me, I also watched <span id="trigger-1" class="pop-text" data-pop-text-out data-pop-media="media1">Clockstoppers</span> several times but we don’t need to talk about that. Eliza Dushku is still one of my favourite parts of Buffy and I’ve watched all of Tru Calling (a show about a woman working in a morgue and rewinding the day to save those who died) and<span id="trigger-101" class="pop-text" data-pop-text-out data-pop-media="media101"> Dollhouse</span> (a show about a company that programs women to be whatever you want them to be). So yeah I was all in on the Bradford and Dushku front. 

          <h1>  The Characters </h1>

          <h3>Tor</h3>

          <p class="content__paragraph content__paragraph--c3">At the beginning of the movie we see <span id="trigger-3" class="pop-text" data-pop-media="media3">Tor</span> as meek but determined, her boyfriend is a douche and she is pretty soft-spoken. She has lived a clearly sheltered life of privilege that she is forced to examine throughout the film. She’s just an early 2000s basic bitch. That said she is extremely moralistic and does attempt to stand up for what she believes in. At times she waivers like when Courtney and Whitney insist on sticking with the stolen cheer but at others, she stands firm such as when she refuses to step down as captain. She clearly has not been exposed to her privilege and attempts to level the playing field when she realises injustices. She wants the best to compete and she wants to play fair. She doesn’t become vindictive or try to take the Clovers down. As far as female leads in teen movies she was one that shows a teenage girl in a positive light. She’s nice to the people on her team and doesn’t seem to care what people think about her..</p>
<h3>Cliff</h3>

<p>Let me start by saying that even now I would fuck  <span id="trigger-5" class="pop-text pop-text--s1" data-pop-media="media5">Cliff</span>, for the entirety of this film (I checked Jesse Bradford was 21 in 2000, so it’s all kosher), he is straight-up sex and I stand by that. He starts off so strong with the ‘loser sneeze’ rant cementing my attraction to sarcastic men for the rest of my life. He’s not intimidated by the idea that Tor is smart and is flirty without being creepy which apparently is a difficult thing in teen movies. Then we see his bedroom, the posters on the wall, him playing the guitar, what a dreamboat and <span id="trigger-7" class="pop-text pop-text--s3" data-pop-media="media7">his face</span> when he sees her is what tween dreams are made of.  Bring It On showed me what sexual tension is and that he and Tor brushing their teeth is hotter than any interaction with any man I’ve ever had. The only cringey scene is at the regionals where he waves at Tor when she is being scaled by the judge. Read the room Cliff, read the room. But then he made her that tape, with a just okay song but it had a lot of heart and is a small yet important plot point. I’m convinced Cliff is the reason I liked pop-punk music throughout my teen years. I remember that a friend had the Bring It On DVD which had an extended scene that showed Cliff and Tor at College, she was still a cheerleader and they were still together and I so desperately wanted that to be the second movie, instead we got Bring It On Again and Cliff was nowhere to be seen. </p>
<h3>
The Clovers</h3>
<p>
<span id="trigger-2" class="pop-text" data-pop-media="media2">The Clovers</span> are 100 percent better than the Ranco County Torros, they should have their own film. Isis is a true leader; she is confident in herself and her team. Her line ‘I know you didn’t think a white girl made that shit up’ made the movie instantly perfect again. Them refusing the handout from Tor highlights their character, Isis doesn’t allow Tor to relieve herself of the guilt of stealing and stops her from becoming a white saviour. I am surprised they didn’t confront Big Red sooner but in a way, it makes sense as the Clovers never fall into the trope of being vindictive or attempt to bring the Toros down through pranks or schemes. Their aim is to bring to light their talent and show up the predominately white cheer teams that have ignored or stolen from them. They are the better performers and look, do I think the crowd would be that amped at regions? No, do I care? Also no, they have better cheers and rhythm and are highlighting race and inequality in competitive cheerleading.</p>
<h3>
Missy </h3>
<p>
Missy was the badass I wanted to be. I loved her clothing and tried to do those <span id="trigger-8" class="pop-text pop-text--s4" data-pop-media="media8">twists</span> in my hair but the  <span id="trigger-17" class="pop-text" data-pop-media="media17">tool</span> would just create knots and became very difficult to remove. She’s witty and unflinching, I imagine most of the time she is just thinking “fuck it.” As a nine-year-old I was way too into gymnastics having gone to watch it at the Sydney Olympics in 2000, I thought Missy was just the shit. She’s a supportive friend and she and Tor don’t have a cliche ark where their friendship momentarily falls apart because one of them lied. Her and Cliff have such a chill relationship, I assume it is because they basically raised each other what with their parents never being there. She doesn’t do the overprotective sibling bullshit when she realises Cliff and Tor have feelings for each other but instead is supportive of their relationship.</p>

  <h3>
The Side Characters
</h3>
<p>
These are the characters that are part of the story but do little to nothing to drive the plot. Ever the egalitarian I’ll do this alphabetically starting with <span id="trigger-14" class="pop-text" data-pop-media="media14">Aaron.</span> Even at nine years of age, I knew Aaron was a straight-up douche the instant he interacted with Tor’s parents and said the phrase ‘I can’t mac on you in front of the parentals.’ He’s a completely pointless character and the story could function in almost the exact same fashion without him. I assume that they wanted there to be a love triangle but Tor seems to hate him from the beginning and he just cheats on her for the entire film. That said her break-up speech is amazing and I hope that if I ever have to break up with a straight-up douche I am as composed and a savage as her. <span id="trigger-4" class="pop-text" data-pop-media="media4">Big Red</span> is immediately forgettable and I just remember being confused as to why Valerie Birkhead from Sabrina the Teenage Witch was being a bitch. Big Red is way too invested in a high school cheer squad for someone in college and she should get a life. Dacy is another pointless character and the fat-shaming is just unacceptable, she has an ass most women are striving to have in 2020. <span id="trigger-22" class="pop-text" data-pop-media="media22">Courtney and Whitney</span>  are intended to be the mean girls in this movie and admittedly they do deliver some killer one-liners such as “she puts the itch in bitch.” I imagine they are both Karen’s in 2020. <span id="trigger-15" class="pop-text pop-text--s5" data-pop-media="media15">Jan</span> is a skeeze and the epitome of toxic masculinity, he continuously overly sexualises every interaction in an attempt to overcompensate for the fact that he is a cheerleader. Which dude, like why? Be a better role model for straight men who want to cheer and breakdown gender barriers. <span id="trigger-33" class="pop-text" data-pop-media="media33">Les</span> is the hype man we all need in our life, he is intelligent and supportive and the scene where he interacts with the other male cheerleader Tim has the perfect amount of sexual tension and teenage nerves. Tor’s brother Justin is gross and I can’t stand when they make child characters talk like adults, it also appears that his entire family hates him. We never learn who Kasey is but she’s always kind of just there, it feels like she originally had a bigger part but it was mostly cut out. Sparky Polastri is disgusting and I skipped over his scene, spirit fingers were a large part of my childhood jazz routines though and I hated them much like I hate him now.
